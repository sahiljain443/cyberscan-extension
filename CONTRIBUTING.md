- Handle permissions appropriately
- Respect user privacy and data protection
- Use Chrome APIs efficiently
- Test manifest v3 compatibility

## üîí Privacy & Security Guidelines

### PII Protection
- Never log or expose personally identifiable information
- Ensure all new features respect the PII deidentification system
- Test that sensitive data is properly anonymized before external API calls
- Follow the principle of data minimization

### API Integration
- Secure handling of API keys in local storage
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Follow rate limiting best practices
- Validate all external API responses

### Content Security
- Sanitize all user input and webpage content
- Prevent XSS and injection vulnerabilities
- Use Content Security Policy appropriately
- Handle malicious webpage content safely

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
- Test the extension on different types of websites:
  - Corporate websites
  - E-commerce sites
  - Social media platforms
  - News websites
  - Technical documentation sites
- Verify all tabs (IPs, Domains, AI Analysis) work correctly
- Test with and without various API keys configured
- Check error handling with invalid or malicious content

### Privacy Testing
- Verify PII deidentification works correctly
- Check console logs for proper anonymization
- Test that no sensitive data is sent to external APIs
- Verify local storage security

### Performance Testing
- Test on pages with large amounts of content
- Verify extension doesn't slow down page loading
- Check memory usage and resource consumption
- Test responsiveness of the popup interface

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Critical Security Requirements
- **Never commit API keys** or sensitive credentials
- **Follow secure coding practices** to prevent vulnerabilities
- **Report security vulnerabilities privately** before public disclosure
- **Test for XSS, injection, and other web security issues**
- **Validate all external data** before processing

### Privacy Requirements
- All webpage content must be processed through PII deidentification
- No personal data should be logged or stored permanently
- API calls must use anonymized data only
- User consent and transparency are paramount

## üìñ Documentation

### Required Documentation Updates
- Update README.md for new features or significant changes
- Add inline code comments for complex functions
- Update installation guides if setup process changes
- Document new API integrations or configuration options
- Include privacy impact assessments for new features

### Code Documentation
- JSDoc comments for all public functions
- Clear variable naming and function descriptions
- Explanation of any complex algorithms or security measures
- API integration documentation with error handling examples

## üéØ Project Goals

Keep these goals in mind when contributing:

### Primary Goals
- **Security First**: All features should enhance cybersecurity analysis
- **Privacy Protection**: User data privacy is non-negotiable
- **Accuracy**: Threat intelligence should be reliable and actionable
- **User Experience**: Interface should be intuitive for security professionals

### Technical Goals
- **Performance**: Extension should be fast and responsive
- **Reliability**: Graceful error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Maintainability**: Clean, documented, and testable code
- **Extensibility**: Architecture that supports future enhancements

## üö´ What Not to Contribute

### Unacceptable Contributions
- Features that compromise user privacy or data protection
- Code that bypasses or weakens security measures
- Changes that break existing functionality without proper migration
- Non-security related features that don't align with project goals
- Code that introduces dependencies on external servers or databases

### Discouraged Contributions
- Features that significantly increase resource consumption
- Changes that make the extension incompatible with Chrome policies
- Code that hardcodes configuration or removes flexibility
- Features that require complex setup or additional software

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Branch Naming
- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `security/description` - Security improvements
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- security: Security improvements
- refactor: Code refactoring
- test: Testing improvements
```

### Code Review Process
1. Automated checks must pass
2. Manual testing verification
3. Security review for sensitive changes
4. Privacy impact assessment
5. Documentation review
6. Final approval and merge
